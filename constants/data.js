      `I started learning programming when I was 17 years old üë®üèª‚Äçüíª and I fell in love with the Front-End stack, in 2019 I got a Platzi Scholarship that helped me to keep learning while I was still in Venezuela. In 2020 I migrated to Argentina and had the opportunity to participate in a project that would go to the University of Buenos Aires in 2021, in which I contributed my Front-End skills to update some views of this system.`,
